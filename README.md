# Exercises for Programmers

* I have been feeling some level of insecurity in my ability to problem /
solve effectively and decided after seeing the book "Problems for Programmers" on the PragProg site, that I would attempt to fix this.
This repo will be a collection of challenges written entirely in python. /
The challenges are language agnostic, and are designed that way. All
code will be mine, any references used will be duly noted. The challenges /
ascend in difficulty.

* I will also be keeping notes in this readme as I progress.

## Notes

### Problem Definition

1. Understanding the Problem
This step can also be referred to as information gathering /
we ask questions about the problem we have been given in order /
to get a better understanding of the limitations of the solution/
and the types of design elements that must be built into it.

For example:
> I ask you to build a weather application, is that enough /
information for you to build it? Probably not. Some questions!
* Do you wish it to show all types of weather? Or just sun and rain?
* Do you wish to be able to change locations?
* Do you wish for it to have a GUI?
* Is it to display in C or F?
* What length of forecasts do you require?
* Mobile or desktop?
* Terminal or web based?

Once the questions have been answered, you can construct a problem /
statement that explains what you are building. For example:
> Create a basic weather application. The program should be locked /
to Melbourne and display all weather for the coming week in celcius.
I wish to be able to visit it via a webpage.

2. Discovering Inputs, Processes and Outputs

In order for programs to do their thing, they utilise inputs, processes/
and outputs. Typically in that order.
